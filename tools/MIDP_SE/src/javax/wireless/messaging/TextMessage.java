/**
 * An interface representing a text message.
 * This is a subinterface of
 * {@link Message Message} which
 * contains methods to get and set the text payload. The
 * {@link #setPayloadText(String) setPayloadText} method sets the value
 * of the payload in the data container without any checking whether the value
 * is valid in any way.  Methods for manipulating the address portion of
 * the message are inherited from <tt>Message</tt>.
 *
 * <p>Object instances implementing this interface are just
 * containers for the data that is passed in.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Character Encoding Considerations</h3>
 * <p>Text messages using this interface
 * deal with <code>String</code>s encoded in Java.
 * The underlying implementation will convert the
 * <code>String</code>s into a suitable encoding for the messaging
 * protocol in question. Different protocols recognize different character
 * sets. To ensure that characters are transmitted
 * correctly across the network, an application should use the
 * character set(s) recognized by the protocol.
 * If an application is unaware of the protocol, or uses a
 * character set that the protocol does not recognize, then some characters
 * might be transmitted incorrectly.
 * </p>
